## About

The Apache™ Hadoop® project develops open-source software for reliable,
scalable, distributed computing.<br>
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single
servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and
storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the
library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application
layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of
computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
